# Intro to Socket.io

This project demonstrated a basic knowledge of using node.js, express.js and socket.io. These three technologies are combined to create a basic chatroom that functions in realtime with usernames and supports multiple browsers. 

Issues that came up along the way were package errors with installing npm and xcode correctly on my machine, understanding how the npm dependencies work, and how information is passed or emitted from the browser to the server. 

Overall, I would definitely choose this technology again. It gave me a much stronger understanding of how javascript works and how powerful node.js is for performing in real time. I also began to dabble in jade as an alternative front end template engine, ejs for embedded javascript files (which are very similar in syntax to sinatra erb) and ultimately made the transition from Rails/Sinatra to Node an easier one for me.
